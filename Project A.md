# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION

## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

Firstly, I created an EC2 in Asia Pacific region Tokyo.

Let me list certain parameters when choosing an AWS region which factors should you consider:

* Latency and proximity

* Security and regulatory compliance

* Service Level Agreements (SLA)

And finally, the most important is the **cost**
